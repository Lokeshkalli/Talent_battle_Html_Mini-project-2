        <p>The Qutub Shahi Tombs are located in the Ibrahim Bagh (garden precinct), close to the famous Golconda Fort in
            Hyderabad, India. They contain the tombs and mosques built by the various kings of the Qutub Shahi
            dynasty.[3] The galleries of the smaller tombs are of a single storey while the larger ones are two storied.
            In the centre of each tomb is a sarcophagus which overlies the actual burial vault in a crypt below. The
            domes were originally overlaid with blue and green tiles, of which only a few pieces now remain.
            The complex was put by UNESCO on its "tentative list" to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, with others
            in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number of
            different sultanates).

            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp During the Qutb Shahi period, these tombs were held in great
                veneration. But after their reign, the tombs were neglected until Sir Salar Jung III ordered their
                restoration in the early 19th century. A garden was laid out, and a compound wall was built. Once again,
                the tomb-garden of the Qutb Shahi family became a place of serene beauty. All except the last of the
                Qutb Shahi sultans lie buried here.</p>

               <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sultan Quli Qutb Mulk's tomb, the style of which sets the example for the tombs of his descendants, is
                on an elevated terrace measuring 30 meters in each direction. The tomb chamber proper is octagonal, with
                each side measuring around 10 meters. The entire structure is crowned by a circular dome. There are
                three graves in this tomb chamber and twenty-one laid out on the surrounding terrace, all of which lack
                inscription except for the main tomb. The inscription on Sultan Quli's tomb is in three bands, in the
                Naskh and Tauq scripts. The inscription refers to Sultan Quli as Bade Malik (Great Master) — the
                endearing term by which all people of the Deccan used for him. The tomb was built in 1543 A.D. by the
                Sultan, during his lifetime, as was the custom.[6]</p>

               <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Near the tomb of Sultan Quli is that of his son, Jamsheed, the second in the line of Qutb Shahi sultans.
                Built in 1550 A.D.,[7] this is the only Qutb Shahi tomb which has not been fashioned from shining black
                basalt. Its appearance, too, is quite unlike the other tombs in the garden — it rises gracefully in two
                stories, unlike the squat tombs of the other kings. Jamsheed Quli Qutb Shah's is the only tomb of a Qutb
                Shahi ruler without any inscriptions; of course, Jamsheed's son, Subhan's tomb also does not have any
                inscriptions. Subhan Quli Qutb Shah ruled for a short time. Subhan's tomb stands midway between the
                tombs of his father and grandfather. He was popularly called Chhote Malik (Small Master).</p>

            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sultan Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah's tomb, built in 1580, after his death, is slightly larger than Sultan Quli's
            tomb.[8] Traces of the enameled tiles, which once adorned this mausoleum, can still be seen on the southern
            wall. The tomb has two graves in the main chamber and 16 on the terrace; some of them probably are those of
            his six sons and three daughters. There are inscriptions in the Thuluth script on all faces of the
            sarcophagus. The three famous calligraphists — Isphalan, Ismail and Taqiuddin Muhammad Salih — who left a
            store of Naskh, Thuluth and Nastaliq inscriptions on the many Qutb Shahi edifices in the city, were
            contemporaries of Ibrahim Shah.</p>

            <p>&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp
                Tomb of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah
                Sultan Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah's mausoleum is considered the grandest of the Qutb Shahi tombs. Built in
                1602 A.D., the tomb is on a terrace of 65m square and 4m high. A flight of steps leads to the mausoleum
                proper, which is 22 m square on the outside and 11 m square on the inside. There are entrances on the
                southern and eastern sides. The tomb is in a vault below the terrace. Inscriptions in Persian and the
                Naskh scripts decorate it.

                Another grand mausoleum is that of the sixth sultan, Muhammed Qutb Shah. The facade of this tomb was
                once decorated with enameled tiles; only traces are now evident. There are six graves and inscriptions
                in Thuluth and Naskh. The mausoleum was built in 1626. Sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah's tomb is the last of
                the royal tombs, as Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (Tana Shah), the last Qutb Shahi Sultan, was a prisoner in the
                fortress of Daulatabad, near Aurangabad, when he died. While the tombs of those who ruled dominate the
                area, interspersed are many other monuments, most of them tombs of other members of the royal family.

                The tomb of Fatima Sultan, with its bulbous dome, is near the entrance to the tomb-garden. Fatima was
                the sister of Muhammed Qutb Shah. Her tomb houses several graves, two with inscriptions. Immediately to
                the south of Muhammed Quli's tomb are three uninscribed tombs. There are the mausoleums of Kulthoom,
                Muhammed Qutb Shahi's granddaughter born of the son of the sultan's favourite wife Khurshid Bibi, her
                (Kulthoom's) husband and daughter. Kulthoom's tomb is on the west of this cluster.</p>
            </p>
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe twin-tombs of the two favourite hakims (physicians) of Sultan Abdullah — Nizamuddin Ahmed Gilani and
                Abdul Jabbar Gilani — were built in 1651. They are among the few Qutb Shahi tombs that are not of
                royalty. Another pair are those of Premamati and Taramati, the favourite courtesans of Sultan Abdullah
                Shah, were laid to rest beside his tomb. One other tomb which is not that of a Qutb Shahi family member
                is that of Neknam Khan. Neknam Khan, who served in Abdullah's army, was the commander-in-chief of the
                Carnatic. His tomb is on a platform outside the mausoleum of Ibrahim Qutb Shah. It was built in 1672,
                two years after Nekam Khan's death.

                Archways at Qutb Shahi Tombs
                The last sultan of the dynasty, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (also known as Tana Shah), was not buried alongside
                his ancestor. Instead, he was buried at Khuldabad. The mausoleum which Abul Hasan, the last Qutb Shahi
                Sultan, began building for himself, actually houses the grave of Mir Ahmed, the son of Sultan Abdullah's
                son-in-law and the sister of Abbas II Safair, the Shah of Persia. The tomb of Fadma Khanum, one of
                Sultan Abdullah's daughters, stands near the mausoleum of her husband, Mir Ahmed. Hers is the only Qutb
                Shahi tomb not surmounted by a dome.
